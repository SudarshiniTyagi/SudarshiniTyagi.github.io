## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/SudarshiniTyagi/SudarshiniTyagi.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Projects and Research

#### Clustering Based Methods for Self-supervised Classification of Images
Explored multiple versions of DeepCluster and Invariant Information Clustering. Achieved final accuracy of 85.1% on STL-10 dataset

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

#### Interpretable high-dimensional image classification with attention-guided localization networks
Used attention to combine information from multiple bounding boxes detected by object detection network to predict image level label in Mammogram images. Increased AUC from 0.91 to 0.93
#### Case Study Companion to "Statistics is Easy" book
Collaborating with Prof. Dennis Shasha and Prof. Manpreet Katari to write a book that explains statistical non-parametric methods for biological data analysis using case studies
#### earning text representations from images for conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
Worked on Generative Adversarial Networks to generate high resolution images from their captions using modified implementation of Stack GANs and Attention based text encoders.
#### Cyberuka: An EEG controlled assistive hand to establish accurate finger control for paralyzed patients
Classified EEG data into 6 types of hand signals viz. HandStart, FirstDigitTouch, BothStartLoadPhase, LiftOff, Replace and BothReleased. (Recognized in CISCO Ideate challenge as a promising project)
